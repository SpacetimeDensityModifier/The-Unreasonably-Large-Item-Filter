###Welcome to The Unreasonably Large Item Filter (TULIF), enjoy your stay (if you're scrolling through, it'll be a while). Feel free to change anything as you wish, but good luck with a comprehensive alteration (you'd be better off asking me to change it officially than doing it yourself). Please ask me (SpacetimeDensityModi on Reddit or in the Filter's thread at https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1715657) if you want to use parts of the filter. :D ###

###TULIF filter provides an easy to understand, comprehensive experience that is as useful for noobs (and actually helps them to learn the game) as it is for frequent (and highly experienced) players. ###

### The filter has three primary purposes: 
#1. A way to tell what belongs to a recipe (Jeweller's, Chromatic, etc.): Highlight with a border and/or text color matching the reward for completing the recipe).
#2. The highlighting of top tier items for however long they are top tier for (yes, through the entire game... every base item is included in text somewhere in here).
#3. To be able to tell at a glance what *kind* of loot has dropped. Jewels, gems, cards, currency, etc each have distinct but not too invasive looks to tell you what you're looking at. For example, opening the gem chest in the uber lab will at a glance tell you if you dropped any drop-only gems, quality gems, and separates support and Vaal gems from skill gems.
#Additionally, the filter will highlight items relevant to challenges for the current league (Divination Cards, this league), mechanics of past leagues, and some items have sounds associated with them.

###TULIF begins hiding non-top tier items at the end of Act II Normal (normal rarity items) and the end of Act III Normal (magic rarity items). It then begins hiding Top Tier bases at the end of act IV Normal (normal rarity items) and the end of Act IV Cruel (magic rarity items). These are hidden, but still have the top tier highlight while hidden, so you can hunt for bases without having to see every item drop. ###

###If you do not want to hide any items, go into your preferred text editor and select Edit>Replace>find "Hide" replace with "Show" (without quotes)>Replace All. This is tedious process to reverse, so if you make modifications to the filter other than this please save a copy somewhere in case you want to hide items in the future (and without having to redo all of your changes). Likewise, if you're looking to hide some items just change "Show" to "Hide" for the relevant block. If you Ctrl+F "Strict" you'll easily find the toggle to hide non-top tier rare items (if you're heavy into endgame or are MF this is a good choice).###

###If you do not want some drop sounds, Ctrl+F "AlertSound" and seek for the one you want to disable (just put a # in front of PlayAlertSound).###
