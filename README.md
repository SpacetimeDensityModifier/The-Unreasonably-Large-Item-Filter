###TULIF filter provides an easy to understand, comprehensive experience that is as useful for noobs (and actually helps them to learn the game) as it is for frequent (and highly experienced) players. ###

###TULIF gives an idea of item progression throughout the ENTIRE game, by way of highlighting and leveling with you. There are two primary colors of backgrounds to note in this filter, green and blue, that appear when you highlight an item. If an item highlights GREEN, it is the top base of that item type for that area level. If an item highlights BLUE in any of three shades, that indicates that the item is efficient for leveling at that area level (with how deep the blue is representing how efficient that item is). An efficient item MAY or MAY NOT be a top tier base, as many factors are involved here (sockets, links, item type, base relative to area level, rarity, etc). The way to tell between a recipe highlight (Jeweller's, Chromatic, etc.) and an efficiency/tier highlight is as follows: With the former there is a border and/or text color matching the reward for completing the recipe, and with the latter two the background is black but gains color when you highlight it with the mouse. ###

###TULIF begins hiding non-efficient, non-top tier items at the end of Act II Normal (normal rarity items) and the end of Act III Normal (magic rarity items). It then begins hiding Top Tier bases at the end of act IV Normal (normal rarity items) and the end of Act II Cruel (magic rarity items). These are hidden, but still highlight green if you mouse over them, so you can hunt for bases without having to see every item drop. Efficient items are never hidden, but naturally occur less often as you progress. ###

###If you do not want to hide any items, go into your preferred text editor and select Edit>Replace>find "Hide" replace with "Show" (without quotes)>Replace All. This is not an easily reversible process, so if you make modifications to the filter other than this 	please save a copy somewhere in case you want to hide items in the future (and without having to redo all of your changes).###

###If you do not want some drop sounds, Ctrl+F "AlertSound" and seek for the one you want to disable (just put a # in front of PlayAlertSound).###
